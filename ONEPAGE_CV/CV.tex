%\section{Personal Statement}
%\vspace{-8pt}
%\hrulefill\\
%\vspace{8pt}
%\vspace{-10pt}
%I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, New York. I work with Dr. An\u{z}e Slosar and Dr. Erin Sheldon on projects within the Dark Energy Survey and LSST Dark Energy Science Collaborations. I am primarily interested in gravitational weak lensing and galaxy cluster cosmology, including mass calibration and the mitigation of limiting systematics. I also construct emulators for cosmology analyses by interpolating between large suites of gravitational $N$-body simulations to create precise physical models.

%I completed my PhD in Physics at the University of Arizona working with Professor Eduardo Rozo, and my MSc in High Performance Computing at the University of Edinburgh with Professor David Henty. I received my BA in Physics and Astronomy at Amherst College in Massachusetts while completing a senior thesis with Professor Fulvio Melia.

%\section{\centerline{RECENT WORK}} 
%\vspace{8pt}
%\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
%  \item {\bf The Aemulus Project}: Developing cosmic emulators for predicting cosmological signals at the sub-percent level. Constructed from a suite of $N$-body simulations using Gaussian Processes.
%  \item {\bf DES Y1 Weak lensing mass calibration}: Determining the mass-richness relation for optically selected galaxy clusters. Performed the mass modeling, developed new software to accurately estimate the covariance of the data, performed statistical analysis on the results using Bayesian statistics and MCMC.
%  \item {\bf LSST-DESC Core Cosmology Library}: Core developer of Core Cosmology Library (CCL) used in projects throughout the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). CCL is a collection of routines for predicting theoretical quantities related to geometry and large scale structure of the universe. I maintain the primary documentation and help integrate halo models.
%\item {\bf DES SV Weak lensing mass calibration}: Performed the mass modeling and statistical inference of the results. Implemented new code to account for cluster miscentering.

%\item {\bf PHYS 105: Introduction to scientific computing}: Designed and taught my own curriculum for the class that is still used today. Integrated Python and data visualization into the course.
%%\item {\bf Supermassive black holes in the early Universe}: Investigated the timescales undertaken for supermassive black holes via Eddington accretion in different cosmological models.
%%\item {\bf Supermassive black holes in the early Universe}: Demonstrated that high redshift supermassive black holes can form via Eddington accretion in the $R_{\rm h} = ct$ Universe, even though this is impossible in $\Lambda$CDM.
%%\item  {\bf A test of cosmological models using high-z measurements of H(z)}: Compared the ability of $\Lambda$CDM and the $R_{\rm h} = ct$ Universe to accomodate the distance-redshift relation given by cosmic chronometer data via model selection techniques.
%%\item  {\bf Modeling the Effectiveness of Tax and Benefits Policies}: A masters thesis in which I parallelized a program that m odels the effect of tax and benefit reforms on individuals' education, employment and savings choices. Completed under Professor David Henty.
%%\item  {\bf The Contribution from Low-Mass X-Ray Binaries to the Positron Annihilation in the Galactic Disk}: A senior thesis that calculated the pair production rate within the accretion disc of LMXBs. Completed under Professor Fulvio Melia.
